	<p>This personal creed is inspired from a quote
		by Reki Kawahara, <i>"I'd rather trust and regret
		than doubt and regret".</i> </p>
	<br>
	<p>I believed that regret and doubt could have been the 
		lowest points in one's life. This is not what
		I intend to put in some thought, especially 
		during the pandemic.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Now, this is the question that I asked myself: "Is there an exact
		definition of such moment?" To rephrase, the question implies 
		that not everything is what it seems. Just cherish and be positive
		and happy to such moment. </p>
